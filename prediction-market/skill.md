## How to Look Up IDs

Most endpoints require an ID that comes from the `/markets` response. Always query markets first, then pass the relevant ID to downstream endpoints.

1. **Polymarket `token_id`** — Query `/polymarket/markets`, find `side_a.id` or `side_b.id` in the response, then pass it to `/polymarket/market-price/{token_id}`.
2. **Polymarket `condition_id`** — Query `/polymarket/markets`, find `condition_id` in the response, then pass it to `/polymarket/candlesticks/{condition_id}`.
3. **Kalshi `market_ticker`** — Query `/kalshi/markets`, find `market_ticker` in the response, then pass it to `/kalshi/market-price/{market_ticker}`.
