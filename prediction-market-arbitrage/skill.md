## How to Look Up IDs

Most endpoints require an ID that comes from the `/markets` or `/matching-markets` responses. Always query markets first, then pass the relevant ID to downstream endpoints.

1. **Polymarket `token_id`** — Query `/polymarket/markets`, find `side_a.id` or `side_b.id` in the response, then pass it to `/polymarket/market-price/{token_id}`.
2. **Kalshi `market_ticker`** — Query `/kalshi/markets`, find `market_ticker` in the response, then pass it to `/kalshi/market-price/{market_ticker}`.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Find Matching Markets (Cross-Platform)

The first step in arbitrage is finding the exact same event on multiple platforms.

#### Match by Event Ticker / Slug

```bash
# Find equivalent markets across platforms using a Polymarket slug
curl -X GET "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/matching-markets/sports?polymarket_market_slug=nba-lakers-vs-celtics" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"

# Or find equivalent markets using a Kalshi ticker
curl -X GET "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/matching-markets/sports?kalshi_event_ticker=KXNBA-24" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"
```

#### Match Sports by Date

```bash
# Find all matching sports markets across platforms for a specific date
curl -X GET "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/matching-markets/sports/nba?date=2024-03-01" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"
```

### 2. Compare Prices

Once matching markets are found, fetch the real-time prices on both platforms to calculate the spread.

#### Get Polymarket Price

```bash
# Fetch the current market price for a Polymarket token
# token_id comes from side_a.id or side_b.id in /polymarket/markets response
curl -X GET "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/polymarket/market-price/{token_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"
```

#### Get Kalshi Price

```bash
# Fetch the current market price for a Kalshi market
# market_ticker comes from /kalshi/markets response
curl -X GET "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/kalshi/market-price/{market_ticker}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Verify Liquidity (Orderbooks)

A price discrepancy is only actionable if there is enough liquidity to execute the trades.

#### Polymarket Orderbook

```bash
# Fetch the latest orderbook snapshot for a Polymarket asset
# token_id comes from side_a.id or side_b.id in /polymarket/markets response
curl -X GET "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/polymarket/orderbooks?token_id={token_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"
```

#### Kalshi Orderbook

```bash
# Fetch the latest orderbook snapshot for a Kalshi market
# ticker (market_ticker) comes from /kalshi/markets response
curl -X GET "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/kalshi/orderbooks?ticker={ticker}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"
```

## Understanding Arbitrage & Odds

- **Prices as Probabilities**: Prices are shown as decimals (e.g., 0.65 = 65% implied probability).
- **Arbitrage Opportunity**: An opportunity exists when the combined price of all mutually exclusive outcomes across different platforms is less than 1.0 (or 100 cents). For example, if "Yes" is trading at 0.40 on Polymarket and "No" is trading at 0.55 on Kalshi, buying both guarantees a payout of 1.00 for a total cost of 0.95 (a 0.05 risk-free profit minus fees).
- **Liquidity Check**: Always check the `/orderbooks` endpoints. A price difference might exist, but if the orderbook lacks depth, executing the trade will cause slippage, eliminating the profit.
